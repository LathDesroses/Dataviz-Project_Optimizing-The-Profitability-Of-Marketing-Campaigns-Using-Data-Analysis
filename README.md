# Marketing Campaign Customer Targeting Analysis

## Description

This project involves a customer targeting analysis for a marketing campaign using two machine learning models: **Random Forest (RF)** and **XGBoost (XGB)**. The objective is to determine the optimal percentage of customers to contact to maximize profit, considering the cost of contacting customers and the revenue generated from successful sales.

## Participants

- **Oumou SOW**
- **Lath ESSOH**

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required for this project:

```bash
pip install seaborn xgboost imbalanced-learn scikit-learn
```

- **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Numpy** for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** for plotting graphs
- **XGBoost** for machine learning classification
- **Imbalanced-learn** for handling class imbalance using techniques like **SMOTE**
- **Scikit-learn** for building models and evaluating performance

## Dataset

- **File used**: `marketing_campaign.csv`
- **Size**: 2241 rows, 29 columns
- **Missing Data**: Some columns contain missing values (e.g., `Income`), which need to be cleaned.

### Key Features:
- `AcceptedCmpX`: Whether the customer accepted an offer (1-5 for different campaigns).
- `Response`: Whether the customer accepted the offer in the last campaign.
- `MntX`: Amount spent on different products (e.g., `MntWines`, `MntMeatProducts`).
- `Recency`: Number of days since the last purchase.

## Data Preprocessing

The data is preprocessed using **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address any class imbalance. Both **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** models are trained on the dataset, with hyperparameter tuning done via **GridSearchCV** to optimize model performance.

## Data Visualization

The analysis includes several visualizations to understand the market, the model's performance and customer response patterns.

## Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated based on their ability to predict which customers are most likely to respond to the marketing campaign. The optimal percentage of customers to contact is determined by calculating cumulative profits, considering the cost of contacting customers and the revenue generated by successful sales.

### Profit Calculation

The goal is to maximize profit by determining the best percentage of customers to contact. Profit for each customer is calculated based on the following costs and revenues:

- **Cost per contact**: $3
- **Revenue per successful sale**: $11

Profit is calculated as:

- **Profit** = Gain if Correct (+8) for correct predictions
- **Loss** = -3 for false predictions

## Answer to the Profit Curve Question

### What is the best percentage of customers to contact to maximize profits?

- **Random Forest**: Achieves maximum profit by contacting approximately **13.44%** of the customers (about **301 customers**).
- **XGBoost**: Achieves maximum profit by contacting **8.62%** of the customers (about **193 customers**).

## Conclusion

- **Random Forest** is more profitable overall but requires contacting a larger percentage of customers.
- **XGBoost** is more efficient in terms of the number of customers contacted, though it generates a lower total profit.

The choice of model depends on whether the goal is to maximize total profit (Random Forest) or minimize the number of customers contacted (XGBoost).
